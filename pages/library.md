SCVO's [Team Digital](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/about/team/) are passionate about digital participation, and we spend lots of our time reading about exciting digital inclusion activity across the country. This year we've even put together our own [report](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/about/annual-report-2015/)! As we come across so many excellent articles, reports and resources we want to share these with you, so check out the list below.
