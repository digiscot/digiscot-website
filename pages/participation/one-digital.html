<h2>One Digital, the next steps&hellip;</h2>

<h3>
    What we got up to last year!
</h3>

<p>
    Throughout 2016 the One Digital team at SCVO were developing the digital skills and confidence of the Scottish third sector. The project has been funded by the Big Lottery fund, and is part of a wider consortium delivering across the UK.
</p>

<p>
    Over the course of the year we raised the profile of digital participation and evolution with over 1000 staff and volunteers, and 500 of these are now trained as digital champions. See the project in numbers below with the 12 Facts of One Digital.
</p>

<p>
    We tested a range of delivery models, working with frontline staff and senior leaders from diverse organisations. The University of the West of Scotland have evaluated these different approaches. The summary report is available below, and you can <a href="files/MCS SCVO Report WEB.pdf" download>download the full report here</a>. An evaluation of the full One Digital programme across all partners will be available in due course.
