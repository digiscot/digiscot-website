## Funding criteria

The following criteria are essential and projects must meet them to be considered for funding:

{:.browser-default}
* Projects aim to [build basic digital skills](/participation/basic-digital-skills/) of people who are older, on lower incomes or facing other forms of inequality.
* Priority will be given to projects which can demonstrate a track record of working with individuals who are facing issues such as poverty, social isolation and other forms of inequality. Previous experience of delivering digital skills training is not necessary.
* Priority will also be given to applications who aim to embed the promotion and development of those skills in the organisations day-to-day activity.
* Awards will typically range from £500 to £10,000; applications for more than this will only be considered in exceptional circumstances.
* Successful organisations must have already joined [Scotland&#39;s Digital Participation Charter](http://charter.scvo.org.uk) or commit to doing so.
* To help us understand what the project has achieved and what lessons others can learn, successful projects will be required to:

  * Ask the individuals they&#39;re supporting to fill out a short questionnaire to gauge their [basic digital skills](/participation/basic-digital-skills/).
  * Provide regular progress updates by posting content to your project page (here&#39;s [an example](/participation/projects/comas/)).

Applications are unlikely to be considered which:

* Are primarily for equipment, capital expenditure, website development or similar types of organisational infrastructure
* Relate to higher level digital skills (e.g. coding clubs)
* Are aimed at children and young people, unless clear evidence is provided on a specific target group&#39;s lack of [basic digital skills](/participation/basic-digital-skills/)
