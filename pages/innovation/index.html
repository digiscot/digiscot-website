        <p>There are some great examples of third sector organisations in Scotland pioneering the use of digital technology, whether through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delivering services online – through innovative digital platforms</li>
            <li>Using social media to inform and engage people</li>
            <li>Using free and low cost tools to reduce costs and improve business processes</li>
            <li>Building websites and apps to address specific user needs</li>
            <li>Online fundraising</li>
            <li>Using data to inform planning and service delivery as well as understand impact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to showcase the innovative work of these organisations in order to inspire others.</p>
        <p>We also want SCVO to set an example by being a digital pioneer, testing new technology and providing appropriate infrastructure support for digital innovation to flourish in Scotland’s third sector.</p>

        <h2>What about infrastructure support?</h2>

        <p>As part of the work that SCVO does on behalf of the third sector in Scotland, we provide a data management and reporting platform (known as Milo) that is used by Scotland’s Third Sector Interfaces (TSIs). Milo is funded by Scottish Government, and TSIs have been using the system to manage their interactions with voluntary organisations and volunteers since 2012.</p>
