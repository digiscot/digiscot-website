## Structure 

Successful applicants for the One Digital senior leader development programme will participate in five full day sessions between Jan-May 2017. At the start of each session an expert speaker will provide a short input, but the bulk of the day will use action learning methodology where participants challenge and explore together. 

This is not a training programme and the facilitator is not there to provide solutions or answers - learning will come from peer discussion. 

Two cohorts will be run on the dates outlined below. The locations are provided as advisory but will be confirmed once applicants have been selected. 

### Cohort 1

In addition to these full day sessions participants are encouraged to discuss and engage with one another in between the sessions, and to organise visits to organisations that can benefit them to progress their own unique plans. 

Where appropriate SCVO and the facilitator will provide networking opportunities and links to resources and people who might be able to offer practical solutions and help as each leader develops an understanding of what direction they want to take.
