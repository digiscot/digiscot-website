Sopra Steria signed the Digital Participation Charter to pledge our support to achieving digital public services which could reduce costs, improve services and change lives.  As an IT and business services organisation we have staff with very valuable digital skills.  Just giving a little of their time, could help someone get online or better still train someone who works with the socially disadvantaged on a daily basis.
