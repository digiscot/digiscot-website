### Project description

The project will aim to build a sustainable network of digitally agile older people in Inverclyde who can carry on the legacy of the project using a co-production approach. The project will provide contextualised digital support for learners based around three themes which we know through experience and listening surveys are attractive to older and disabled learners as well as Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants in Inverclyde: 
•	Local History 
•	Family History 
•	Digital Photography 

For ESA claimants these courses are attractive option as often learners lack confidence to attend employability programmes or more formal learning due to the level of challenge and pace. These courses allow learners to build their skills and confidence in a non-formal setting. It will serve to reduce social isolation. 

The project will be framed in four distinct sections. 

Stage One – Recruitment and Engagement 
•	Recruitment of staff for the project 
•	Building on existing partnerships 
•	Creating new partnerships as necessary 
•	Engagement of new learners through partnerships 
•	Engagement of new learners through CLD Outreach and Engagement team 
•	Engagement of new learners through ESA team at Jobcentreplus 

Stage Two – Building Basic ICT Skills of learners through 6 week 2hr per week course 
•	Tuition on computer basics -mouse, keyboard and computer navigation 
•	Tuition on using a search engine to find the information they need 
•	Tuition on bookmarking useful websites and storing data on device or cloud 
•	Tuition on keeping in touch using emails, instant messaging and social media 

Stage Three – Progression to 6 week 2hr per week contextualised provision on Local History, Family History and Digital Photography 
•	Tuition on using using a search engine to gain accurate sources of support 
•	Tuition on using internet forums for their course 
•	Tuition on internet security 
•	Tuition on storing data 
•	Tuition on creating and sharing data 
•	Tuition on copyright and protecting content 

Stage Four – Progression on to self-sustaining/co-production groups, volunteering or other learning opportunities. 
•	Groups will have the option to continue their learning as an independent group using a co-production model with CLD. This model involves the group becoming a constituted group who run the group with support from CLD. The group works towards a structure of learning that does not require a paid CLD Tutor such as peer learning, group projects and special guest speakers. Support for this will be under taken in partnership with CLD core service and the on-going support post project will be covered by CLD. 
•	Individuals from the project will have the opportunity to share their skills in their community through volunteering. CLD will run a volunteer training programme and support the volunteers throughout their time volunteering in the short to long term. Support for this will be under taken in partnership with CLD core service and the on-going support post project will be cover

### Planned project milestones

* Recruitment of staff & Stage 1 Partnership established and learners recruited: January 2016

* Stage 2 Basic ICT Course delivered & Stage 3 Contexualised ICT support: April 2016

* Stage 3 Co-production and volunteering & Stage 1 recruitment of learners for next courses: June 2016

* Stage 4 Basic ICT Course delivered & Stage 3 Contexualised ICT support: October 2016

* Stage 5 Co-production and volunteering: October 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* 50 Older people, disabled people and ESA claimants will build their digital skills to undertake everyday using a digital platform

* 3 groups will continue their learning using the co-production model and supported by CLD and partner organisations

* 5 volunteers will be trained by CLD and supported to cascade their skills learned to other older and disabled Inverclyde Residents

### Project update August 2016

The project started a little later than anticipated, on April 1st 2016

We decided to run the courses in two phases: in **phase 1** four groups started in May and recruited 30 learners (**Project stage 1 complete**). Each of these courses ran for 12 weeks, integrating contextualized ICT skills training into a study of Family and Local History Research (**Project stages 2 and 3 complete July**).  This was a slight departure from the original plan, which was to run a six week course on basic ICT skills, followed by six weeks on Family and Local History (and digital photography).  The rationale for this amendment was that initial ICT assessment identified that many of the learners had sufficient basic ICT skills to start their family and local history, which they were most motivated to do.  In this way ICT development ran alongside the historical research components. Initial analysis of the *Basic Digital Skills Assessment Questionnaire* showed significant gains at the end of the 12 weeks.

Two of the classes ran in local libraries and completed in July.  Both these groups decided to continue to meet on a voluntary basis, following the Co-production model that Inverclyde Council had successfully introduced for other classes (**Stage 4 – August**).  One learner volunteered to act as a group co-ordinator. Each group has informal volunteers who perform roles in the group from organising materials to dealing with refreshments.  Inverclyde Council CLD and Libraries services will continue to support these co-producing groups in the future. Community Work support is available if the groups want to be constituted and apply for funding. The project will continue to link in with the groups until the end of the funding period.

The other two April start groups ran in a community centre.  One of these groups is on the path to the Co-production model and is currently working with a volunteer tutor and a paid member of staff from within the CLD team (not funded through this project). They are continuing to work on ICT skills and history. It is anticipated that by October they will be meeting with only support from the volunteer tutor. 

Attendance in all four groups was excellent throughout. With a group of learners predominately over 55 one would expect some falling off in attendance due to health problems; furthermore much of the course was undertaken during the main holiday season.  Nevertheless attendance remained above 50% in every class throughout the 12 weeks and showed no falling off towards the end of the programme.   In total the 30 learners in phase 1 accumulated over 400 hours of attendance over the 12 weeks.

Evaluation for all four groups was extremely positive.   Representative examples of feedback from course evaluation:

> *“Great IT backup” “Learnt new skills” “I found the course interesting and informative” “Excellent tutor”* 

**Case study**: a learner started the course with an interest in Family History but limited ICT skills and he was unaware of the potential for using ICT in genealogical research.  Classes on the use of sites such as Ancestry.com and Scotlandspeople.gov.uk enabled him to make great strides in exploring his family tree. He became proficient at using these sites and it enabled him to develop related ICT skills (in managing information, transacting and problem solving).  He reported that he was greatly impressed by what he had learned and that he and his wife now spent much of their spare time on the internet using these new skills.

**Phase 2:**  Three more groups are starting at the end of August and will complete in November.  Again it is hoped that some of these groups will continue to meet and may constitute themselves as formal voluntary organisations studying family and local history.
