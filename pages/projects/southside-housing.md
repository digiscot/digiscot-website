### Project description

This is a partnership bid with Glasgow Life/Glasgow Libraries, Glasgow Homelessness Network, Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Govan and Craigton Integration Network and Glasgow Clyde College. Southside Housing Association is the lead partner. The project will take place within the Pollokshields and Cardonald/Craigton areas of Glasgow. The project broadly aims to support people currently not digitally engaged but who would benefit greatly. 

Key elements of the project include:

* Installation of wi-fi and IT equipment within 4 community bases; providing local, safe and welcoming environments for learning. The bases are community flats (or resident lounge within sheltered housing complexes) converted into common space for local people to come together and participate in positive activities. Current activities include easy exercise, story telling, arts, and healthy cooking. By providing wi-fi and IT equipment we will be able to extend these activities to include digital learning. It should be noted that we have 3 other community bases with wi-fi, and we work in close partnership with the Nan McKay Memorial Hall as a welcoming base for learning. These spaces will be used within the project, however in order to reach the target groups outlined above, and a greater number of individuals, this project requires additional support in the form of further wi-fi installation, IT equipment and in-kind support from partners. 

* Delivery of a range of courses (by Glasgow Clyde College) within each community base covering the [basic digital skills](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/about/basic-digital-skills/). By doing so we hope to provide people with the skills to improve their ability to connect with others, save money on-line, enquire and apply for benefits, carry out research and work together to improve, develop and connect within their local areas. We also envisage that by providing wi-fi people may choose to bring their own IT equipment to the bases at a time that suits them (outwith the structured learning/activity times).

* Ensuring that people are not simply offered the opportunity of participating in digital learning and using wi-fi in their own time (within the bases), but that they are encouraged to connect with existing services and organisations, thus using the project as a foundation for creating pathways to these services and therefore greater outcomes for participants. These other services are currently offered within local libraries, Glasgow Clyde College, the Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Glasgow Homelessness Network and the Govan and Craigton Integration Network. We recognise the importance of ensuring people know what other support exists, which is why this project will be delivered in partnership. 

By delivering this project we hope to address some of the barriers people find to going online. Some of which include ‘it’s too difficult to learn’; ‘it’s too expensive’; ‘worrying about privacy/viruses; ‘no connection/computer’ (CarnegieUK Trust, 2013. Across the Divide –Tackling Digital Exclusion in Glasgow).

### Planned project milestones

* Installation of Wi-Fi within 4 community bases: December 2015

* IT equipment purchased and ready for use. This will include: tablets, keyboards for tablets, mice, tablet covers, smart screen, memory sticks and adapters, laptops, paper and printer): December 2015

* A range of learning programmes for communities developed in partnership with Glasgow Clyde College and Glasgow Life (library services), Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Glasgow Homelessness Network and Govan and Craigton Integration Network: January 2015

* 14 Learning programmes promoted and delivered to communities: October 2016

* Community bases utilised informally/ad-hoc by local people: October 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Participants are more equipped, confident and able to use their digital skills to carry out and manage day-to-day activities (e.g. on-line shopping, in touch with family, on-line forums/support, resolving benefit/welfare issues).

* Participants have improved skills and abilities, and increased knowledge and understanding of how to improve their employment and financial opportunities through IT and internet sources. 

* Participants have an increased awareness of and connectedness to existing community services and resources. 

* Participants are more connected to others in their community, and are motivated to work together to improve their local area/community, using IT/digital methods as a means to supporting this process.
