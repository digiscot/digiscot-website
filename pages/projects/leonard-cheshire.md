## Project plan


### Project description

We will employ a specialised Digital Advisor one day per week to deliver digital inclusion workshops and personalised one-to-one support.  The post-holder will be home-based and responsible for delivering the following activities over 9 months:  6 digital outreach community workshops and work with 40 disabled people learn basic online skills across the Highlands.  The project will: Build IT literacy capacity of people with disabilities through increased digital inclusion and specialised support; Digital inclusivity will lead to disabled people having the opportunity to maintain and cultivate relationships (both professionally and personally), promoting social inclusion and enhanced well-being; Increase disabled clients’ opportunities to access various online tools, such as, completing employment applications, internet banking, online shopping, email, and social networking; Increased self-esteem and confidence in people with disabilities, leading to more people with disabilities becoming digitally engaged and improving their quality of life.

## Project Milestones

We organised a meeting with Cheshire House in order to determine what subjects the clients would be interested
in.  Each client was asked what they would like to achieve and the reasons they wanted to become more proficient in use of the computer.#
We gave them some ideas but also asked for their preferences:
-	Internet safety
-	Basic course of using computers
-	How to use the technology (moving on to how to use it by yourself)
-	How to find things on the internet
-	Want to find educational games (lower the amount of time spent on youtube)
-	How to edit settings on the computer (i.e. increase the font size, change size of the cursor -> looking at it for different versions)
-	How they can use a computer to make art
-	Other Points
-	Additional equipment (chin buttons, arms, magnifying screens)
-	Interested in having volunteers to help with computers
-	
We have included below the numbers interested in the different workshop areas. Unfortunately we won’t be able to combine the workshop currently due to the limited amount of computers and high interest from day services. We are hoping to fix an additional computer that will enable us to run the workshop for five people.

There is definitely a possibility of getting both volunteers and residents involved depending on their availability.
