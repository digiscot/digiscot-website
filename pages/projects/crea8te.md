### Project description

The project will target ethnic minority women who have been working with Saheliya & progressed enough to be in a position to cope with the language & learning demands of basic computing classes. We will work in partnership utilising the expertise of the Digital Skills Academy (DSA) to deliver a high quality learning programme which will offer Microsoft Digital Literacy certification. 

The project will give the learners essential skills to help with the process of integration & employment which they have embarked on with Saheliya. The project will have a significant impact on the women we will support, giving them the skills to enable them to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search for cost savings for utilities & goods, have social contact with others & even keep up with their children’s activities online. 

Giving people the skills they are expected to have automatically by the welfare system, enables them to meet Jobcentre expectations & help avoid the possibility of sanctions which are having a major impact on people living in poverty. 

The project will be delivered in Saheliya premises where learners can access existing equipment in the form of PCs, laptops & tablets. They will also access in-house childcare which will facilitate their learning. This combination of expert digital learning support & the emotional & practical support offered by Saheliya makes this project unique. 

The classes will be delivered in 2 half-day sessions per week by an experienced IT trainer & will run for up to 8 weeks. We plan for 6-7 people in each class (12 per week) who will be supported by at least 1 volunteer. We will run 3 of these classes over the course of one year. 

We plan to recruit volunteers from Saheliya clients who have more advanced IT skills. Our evidence from working with clients is that there is a sufficient number of more highly educated & experienced clients to provide this aspect of the service. The evidence of DSA is that the role of volunteers is crucial to ensure individualised learning can be achieved.
Individual assessments will take place at the start of each course to enable an individualised learning plan to be developed for each learner. The use of volunteers enables the learners to develop at their own pace. In addition, we plan to engage at least 2 members of Saheliya staff to train to become digital champions. This will embed the project in the organisation & enable the staff to run additional drop-in sessions to provide practice opportunities for the learners to continue to access the equipment on an additional half day per week during the class.

### Planned project milestones

* The first class will be recruited and delivery started: December 2015
* Milestone 1 Update
* As this is a partnership project, we started the project by developing a project plan to make sure that both partners understood their role and their contribution to reaching the project milestones. 
* We recruited for our first group of learners in December by holding assessments to make sure the class was the right thing for them. They started their training in January. The women have varying levels of English which has meant that we have had to develop our existing learning materials so that they were suitable for ESOL learners.  We have also developed additional learning material to meet their needs.
* The project has been a steep learning curve for everyone concerned but extremely rewarding. There will be lots to report in 'Lessons leared' by the time the project has finished. The learners are very motivated, coming in early to get extra practice and not stopping for a break.  We recruited 6 learners initially with a further 4 in the process of recruitment at the moment. 3 learners have now passed their Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy certificates and are now ready to continue at a different class to improve their Microsoft Word skills.  The other learners need slightly more time due to the language barrier but we expect them to be up to speed soon. 
* Recruit and train 2 volunteers to support the delivery of further training: January 2016
* We recruited 1 volunteer from Saheliya clients and a second volunteer who had already been helping with Digital Skills Academy's Use IT courses, but had experience of teaching ESOL.  Her experience is extremely useful and has allowed us to give 1-1 support to those who were finding learning more of a challenge.
* 
* Recruit and deliver the second round of courses: April 2016
* Recruit and deliver the third round of courses: August 2016
* Train 2 staff members of Saheliya to become digital champions: October 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Development of basic digital literacy training will become embedded in Saheliya through the training of the digital champions
* Volunteers will be given the opportunity to gain workplace skills and experience to add to their CVs
* 36 ethnic minority women will have the skills to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search, have social contact thereby reducing discrimination & social isolation
*By training 2 Saheliya staff members we will leave a legacy for sustainability
