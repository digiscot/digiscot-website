## Project plan

### Project description

Peer support to increase identified IT learning goals.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1 March 2015

Group sessions to assess current IT skills and goals
Phase 1 
having recruited volunteers willing to share their skills it became clear that we needed to give them some training before starting the project. Training was devised by volunteers and delivered 15/05/16
phase 1 for the learners to assess current It skills and goals was delayed until August 2015 - achieved


### Phase 2 March 2015 

Group sessions to look at matching peers with skills to the goals

Each group member matched with suitable peer supporteer
Phase 2 - matching peer to peer - achieved August 2015


### Phase 3 April 2015

Individual/paired sessions to progress individual learning

Increased confidence and skills shown by participants to identified goals
Phase 3 
8 learners matched with 6 volunteer peer mentors
 - individual sessions between learners and peer mentors arranged and achieved. Increased confidence and skills shown by participants. Peer mentors report learning as they share their skills to the participants. This shows the benefits of peer support rather than tutor style support.


### Phase 4 May 2015

Reassessment of goals and further goal setting

Movement towards goal/achievement of goal
Phase 4
Initial participants all  showed increased confidence and improved skills. Goals were met and people moved towards achievement of longer term goals.
Decided to have another round of the project and use Drop-In format this time.
6 week drop in organised and advertised through the Volunteer Centre Dundee contacts and email distribution list. posters also distributed for display around the city.
Drop in to be manned by Peer mentors with staff support. 
Wk 1 - I participant gained confidence in her own abilities working 1-1 with peer mentor
Wk 2 - 3 participants engaged with each other and staff member to share skills and learn from each other. I participant had help from staff member to do some advanced word processing, while the same participant supported another participant to learn about her smart phone.
Wk 3 - 1 participant worked with peer mentor to look at Excel - he increased his confidence doing this.




## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project X, Y, Z.

In terms of outputs we delivered A, B and C.

Outputs:

Overall this project has reached **18** people who have learned from each other and gained confidence and increased their skills. 

We delivered two training sessions for the peer mentors and 1 matching session for the participants. Each participant had a variety of different individual sessions with their matched Peer mentor. 

The Drop in sessions (6 in total) allowed people to come along with an issue and get immediate support. This worked well and the participants and the peer mentors involved all have gained confidence and skills from this.



In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has P, Q and R. We know this because J, K and L.
