### Project description
We have a rich history of using technology to enrich our workshops, and the results are undeniable. Joyful, high quality creative work has been the backbone of the hundreds of lives we have changed for the better. Using technology is also a great risk, we have seen cyberbullying, dangerous behaviour online and inappropriate use of technology. Our staff are trained to respond to these events and we all know the vulnerabilities of the people we work with. Building in a robust layer of IT skill and good sense across all our workshops will take a lot of work and a ‘learning by stealth’ approach. 

For example our photography workshop have created an amazing collection of themed albums, but we do not currently have the capacity to connect or share their work on the internet. This is something that can bring critical attention, the thrill, joy and risk of choosing, displaying, publishing and sharing your work with others is something that we desperately want our students to experience. This grant will help us do that in a safe, structured way. 

The project will be a collaboration between our Education and Curriculum Manager and our workshop facilitators. They will work together to implement the digital skills appropriate to our students in ways that enhance the following workshops throughout the grant period: 

* Photography workshop every Monday (8 Students) 
* Social Media awareness every Thursday (5 Students) 
* Cafe project every Monday/Tuesday (8 Students) 
* Prestonpans Multi Media Workshops every Monday ( 9 Students) 

We will use a mixed environment of technology; tablets, PCs and laptops, office and free software, just as in the real world. We have a donated suite of 10 desktop PC’s all windows, thanks to the TT-Exchange program we have licensed versions of Windows 7. We use free or online version of software including Google Picasa, to manage the photography workshops. This grant will allow us to buy enough tablets so we can have two and sometimes three workshops using them at once.

Another example where we will implement a digital skills layer of learning using this grant is our new cafe project. Funded by Community Food & Health Scotland and the Clothworkers Foundation as well as other smaller funders. It is a small social enterprise that will start out providing healthy lunches cooked by and consumed by our students. We will run the cafe as an enterprise and involve the students in the business, promotion, and research for the cafe. This will be done in a structured way using skills and materials provided by this grant. 

We also have a similar ‘framework’ approach to equipping our students with skills that will help them approach sustainable employment and digital life skills together. This grant will feed into that work, and our application to the RBS Skills and Opportunities fund to add more digital skills and training to our employability themed workshops, including a special strand in the Cafe Project.


### Planned project milestones

* First purchases and staff training starts at the start of December. Staff will receive training from Quarriers based upon their proven Go For It sessions. We will start planning the first workshops; Photography and Social Media workshops first. First purchases include 8 android tablets a secure housing and charging station and 3 wireless hubs: April 2016

* Staff complete lesson plans for all 4 workshops (Photography + Social Media + Cafe project + Preston pans Multi media). By the end of December: staff will also have completed the soft rollout of the program. After reviewing initial evaluation they will have lesson plans developed for the first block of all four workshops. This milestone includes incremental costs for staff time. Both facilitator and Education and curriculum Manager. A baseline version of the Digital Skills test will be taken: May 2016

* Internal analysis and evaluation, corrective steps if necessary. The first 12 week block of workshops will be completed for all four workshops. The first evaluation will be in and we will have a good idea of what is working well and what needs more work. Facilitator evaluation will be ongoing, but will be formally recorded here: August 2016

* Half way evaluation of students and project. The project half way point. The second block of workshops will be evaluated and the program tweaked. If appropriate we will do another modified Digital Skills baseline test. We should have some good outputs by our new, digitally proficient students: August 2016

* Final evaluation and a plan for continuation. The final evaluation is delivered for the last block. We will have a body of knowledge about how to implement digital skills for all our students across all our workshops. We will build on our successes, report our challenges and be equipped for years to come: October 2016 

### Progress Report May 2016

The Boardmaker software has been bought and tried, the disk is able to install on Windows only, so this has been factored into the planning.  The secure housing and charging station has been purchased and a space has been cleared for storage for it.  The wireless hubs have been purchased and plugged in to check their use. 

*2. Workshops*

This has use of iPad built into it, for the students and the staff.  IPad set up time has been set up for 2/5/16 with the assistance of 3 of the facilitators (1 cannot attend).  All staff had refresher training booked on Apple software currently in use as a refresher in advance.
