## Project plan

### Project description

The project will support a six month Digital Internship post which will create a mentored online learning resource for frontline staff working with client groups least likely to have basic digital skills and access. The content is based on the ’23 Things’ approach originally developed for Information Professionals and more recently adopted by the Scottish Government Library as a digital learning approach for civil servants.


## Project milestones

26/06/15 
Initial outline of the project plan created detailing the range of learning covered by the online resource. This covers awareness of Social Media platforms, awareness and use of blogs, online collaboration tools, alerts and awareness tools, searching skills, social media content plans and introducing users to new hardware (Smart boards, tablets, e-readers). A presentation with key members of the target audience from Glasgow Communities and Glasgow Libraries frontline staff was arranged to discuss and agree upon the outlined content of the resource. 

10/06/15 
Targeted programme of support agreed with Moore Legal Tech and Glasgow Kelvin College covering Social Media Marketing & Optimisation, Web design, Content Writing & Optimisation and digital learning delivery platforms such as Moodle. This will aid the creation of the online learning resource, and will determine the finalised platform. 

28/08/15
Digital learning resource created and in place for initial frontline staff use. This is the date set out for the completion of the first instance of the digital online learning resource. At this stage the selected frontline staff members would be given access to use the resource and to begin the course. 

21/09/2015
Review of the project at the halfway stage and how the project is progressing against milestone markers. Report back to SCVO on the progress of the project at this stage and update project webpage. 

05/10/2015 
Review of the initial resource created, establish strengths and weaknesses in the programme and identify areas that need changed or removed to improve it. This will be done through getting the input from members of the frontline staff using the tools. This will be done using an online evaluation to receive the most honest results from participants. 

26/10/15
Arrange handover of course management procedures, learning materials. A programme management and development plan with clear timescales and responsibilities will be agreed and implemented.

09/11/2015
Structure, approach, materials, lessons learned and next steps are agreed, packaged and shared with SCVO and local partners. Best practice and materials are shared both locally and nationally.

27/11/15
Project review and evaluation. Final assessment and evaluation of the project, report back to the SCVO, update the project page to reflect final outcomes and share learning with local partners. Lastly, agree final steps in the programme developments. 

##Project Progress 
As of the 17/08/15 the Glasgow Life Moodle has been implemented and the course content has began to be moved accross to this platform. The initial expectation that the resource would be able to be piloted by the 28/08/15 has been reconsidered, as the content has been expanded to cover a wider range of topic areas. All content is expected to be on the resource by the 04/09/15, at this stage it will be evaluated by Glasgow Life's Digital Tutors. Once this inital evaluation has taken place the project will be piloted with users. Adding in this extra set of inital evaluations that was not previously considered will help in establishing any areas of the resource that need furhter work before it is given to frontline staff.  

Glasgow Kelvin College is providing members of staff to aid in the initial set up of the Moodle. They are providing help with the Moodle platform and how best to use this educational tool, as well as allowing us to host the Glasgow Life Moodle on their servers. 

To reflect the change to the completion date of the Moodle and taking into consideration the extra evaluation process that is being used the dates of all project milestones have been moved forward two weeks. This still allows for project completion within the six month timeframe.
