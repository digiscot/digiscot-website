## Project plan
The aims of the project are that:
•	women involved in the project will improve their basic digital skills
•	women will have a better understanding of factors that can affect their safety online and in using social media 
•	women will have more confidence to voice their experiences of the impact of welfare reform on their lives
•	we will have a better understanding of the impact of welfare reform on women who have experienced domestic abuse


## Project description
The Recounting Women Project is a partnership between Scottish Women’s Aid, Glasgow East and Perthshire Women’s Aid [here is the link](http://www.perthwomensaid.org.uk/). The project is designed to support women to develop their digital skills to be able to use creative approaches, such as photo-voice and digital story-telling, to gather and disseminate evidence about the impact of welfare reform on their lives. The project will develop women’s confidence in using digital technology, build women’s basic digital skills and their use of cameras and video/audio equipment to tell their stories. These methods allow women to anonymously and creatively share information about their experiences helping to raise public awareness and to influence policy decision makers
