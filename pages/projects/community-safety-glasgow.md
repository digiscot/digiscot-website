### Project description

The project will take place within the Maryhill Hub, located within the Wyndford estate and the Ashgill Recreation Centre - located within Milton. Community Safety Glasgow were successful in gaining funding from Cube Housing Assocation to create a digital inclusion programme that has operated from November 2014 - November 2015. Cube Housing are unable to fund year two of this programme. The Digital Challenge Fund will allow our digital inclusion programme to continue for year two, splitting our member of staff between the Maryhill Hub and Ashgill Recreation Centre.

The project will offer members of the community free access to the internet via our 20 station learning centre within the Maryhill Hub and 14 station centre within the Ashgill Recreation Centre. Free Wi-fi will also be provided. As well as informal drop in, the programme will co-ordinate a range of partners to utalise the learning centre to provide support to clients such as Jobs and Business Glasgow, Glasgow Life, Citizens Advice Service and Glasgow Kelvin College. This will allow a range of informal and formal learning to take place.

As well as co-ordination, the Digital Inclusion Officer will also undertake one to one and group work support sessions around issues such as employability and financial inclusion.

The ICT equipment that will be used are connected to Glasgow Kelvin College’s network and our two centres, built in 2014 (Maryhill) and 2015 (Milton) are all new equipment.

The Maryhill Digital Inclusion programme will also seek to engage volunteers within the centre to support clients. Currently we have one digital inclusion volunteer who contributes 14 hours per week within Maryhill.

### Planned project milestones

* Extend Digital Inclusion Programme to Ashgill Recreation Centre (Dec 15 - Oct 15)
* Continue Digital Inclusion Programme with Maryhill Hub (Dec 15 - Oct 15)
* Recruit and Train 5 Digital Inclusion Volunteers
* Review sustainability of project (External Funding / Volunteers Engagement)

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Residents of Maryhill and Milton have a better understanding of how to access ICT* Increased support in accessing employability support and knowledge to stop unnecessary government sanctions
* Increase in accredited and unaccredited learning opportunities


### Evaluation

In the last 12 months the Maryhill and Milton Digital Inclusion Programme has helped over 1244 people from 50 different nationalities gain access to a PC and get online. Statistics supplied by Glasgow Kelvin College inform us that we have had over 26,200 logins at the Ashgill Recreation Centre and the Maryhill Hub Learning Centres. From October 2015 to October 2016 we have had over 1244 new registered users and we have received over 300 hundred referrals from the DWP to assist Clients with Employability Issues. The Digital Programme continues grow and develop and we have engaged with various partners throughout the north of Glasgow from Glasgow Life, (delivering Basic and Intermediate IT classes), Glasgow Kelvin College (delivering Wider access and Youth Access programmes) and Jobs & Business Glasgow (providing employabilityassistance) etc… to deliver their services within the Learning Centres. We have also recruited our second Digital Inclusion Volunteer who has agreed to commit
4 hours a week to assist in the Learning Centres.  This year we also opened our third Learning Centre situated within our Enterprise Centre in the east end of Glasgow which will assist Individual's within the Criminal Justice System to gain new ICT skills which will further their opportunities in the wider community. We anticipate
that this new project will be as successful as our current Digital Programme.

### Lessons learned

Overall, we have co-ordinated our efforts into engaging with the community and our partners to deliver a successful Digital programme within our Click & Connect Learning Centres.

We identified early on that many within our communities lacked the basic knowledge to get online and set about delivering a comprehensive timetable that would address the needs of the public.

We have engaged effectively to ensure that clients accessing the Learning Centres, many of which have complex needs, language barriers and low self-confidence can have a quality customer experience.

On reflection, we have realised that although we endeavour to help with all things digital there is a limit to what we can achieve with certain individuals many of whom require one to one tuition before moving on to further develop their ICT skills.

### Case Studies/Success Stories

**Rage Hagi**

Rage was referred to the Learning Centre from Maryhill Job Centre to look for employment. Rage had already applied for his SIA Security License and was looking for work in this field. We helped Rage create his Universal Job match account and spent some time showing him how to navigate through the website, upload his newly created Cover Letter and CV. Rage was successful in applying for a job with a Glasgow security firm. As part of the recruitment process Rage was instructed to forward proof of Identity, bank statements etc... Rage was tutored in how to operate the scanner and save scanned documents and how to forward them via email to the employer. I’m pleased to say Rage was successful in gaining employment with the company and continues the Learning Centre.

**John Clark**

John utilized the Learning Centre to look for employment. A trained professional in the Automotive Industry John looked for employment as a Service Manager. John applied for Job with Toyota Cars based in Sudan and was invited to attend an Interview via Skype for Business. We set John up with a headset and webcam for his interview and made sure the Learning Centre was relatively quiet to conduct his conference call. The company were impressed with the outcome and are arranging to meet John in person in London or Glasgow over the next few weeks.

**Asha Kaka**

Asha has been attending the Learning Centre on a regular basis for over a year. She initially attended to look for work and fulfil her claimant commitment with DWP. With Help Asha created a CV and Cover letter and applied for jobs through universal Jobmatch website. Asha found employment with Poundland who gave her the hours she required due to family commitments. Asha is now enrolled for a course with Glasgow Clyde College and is enjoying the prospect of combining her family/work life with further education.  

**Mark Hawthorne**

Mark has been using the learning Centre for over a year. A frequent user Mark attends most days to conduct his job searches for employment etc... In December Mark expressed an Interest in Volunteering within the Learning Centre so we started the application process and I’m pleased to say Mark now commits four hours of his time every week assisting users within the Maryhill Hub Learning Centre. Mark is a trained professional in the Petrol chemical industry and has recently attended an Interview in Germany for post of Strategic Account Manager. Whilst Mark awaits the outcome of their decision to appoint him in the role Mark continues to support users on a weekly basis.
