### Project description

Falkirk Football Community Foundation will utilise the passion for Falkirk Football Club that exists in the community to deliver an innovative programme. The programme will increase people’s basic digital skills and, through practical activities, give them the confidence to use the skills. 

We will initially target people who have an interest in the football club to participate in the programme. Prior to starting we will survey the potential participants to ensure they need the level of course we are delivering. We will use the attraction of the club and the opportunity to meet players and manager as a draw for the programme. To maintain their interest we will structure the programme and specific activities around the club, researching, writing about and other tasks associated with the club to provide relevance to the individuals and to use their digital skills. 

We will deliver three programmes of 10 weeks each during 2015 – 16. Each programme will cater for 10 participants, with the first delivered by staff and the latter two supported by volunteers. The programme will start with the BCS course, Computer and Online Basics, to implement a tried and tested method of introducing basic digital skills. This will include basic start up and functions, finding information, communicating via email and other methods, developing digital content and staying safe on line. 

Following on from this course we will set activities based on people’s needs and what they want to learn. We will use the attraction of Falkirk Football Club to draw people out and provide activities. They will get the opportunity to work in partnership with the Club and Foundation to develop regular online content. This will include a newsletter, press releases, web articles, facebook updates and twitter feeds. In this way they will be able practice their skills in a positive environment promoting an activity and organisation they already support. This will use the different skills they during each week’s 3 hour session, homework and an additional hours supported access provided by FFCF free of charge. 

We will use our experience in delivering community and employability programmes to increase participant’s self-confidence and self-esteem alongside their practical skills. Barriers for older people getting online are likely to include the basic digital skills but more importantly the confidence to learn and put into practice new skills. We will gently develop this confidence and encourage a growth mindset in participants, so that they can learn from the course and then continue to develop their skills. 

We will use the attraction of football to deliver an innovative programme that engages people, provides a purpose to learn digital skills and the confidence to use those skills in their everyday lives.
