### Project description

Our primary focus will be on the security sections of the Basic Digital Skills definition starting with security software and how to choose one, use it, check for updates and what the reports and warning mean. Once the learners are confident that they are safe to go on line we will then work through the other areas of the basic digital skills safety sections covering the areas of interest of the learners. 

The learners will be local to the area and the sessions will be designed around their backgrounds and interests. The focus of the knowledge sharing will on their interests so the safety element becomes a natural part of a fun and interesting session and the learners are not put off or scared away by highly technical safety discussions.

The project will run in Kingussie, Badenoch and Grantown, Strathspey and will be run once a week over 5 weeks covering a different topic each week. We will run 3 of these sessions in each town over the year and learners from the first session will be invited back to the subsequent sessions to refresh their knowledge by working with a new learner and sharing what they learned. There will be an IT qualified tutor at all sessions who will plan and deliver the contents of the sessions. 

The devices used will be laptops in Strathspey and either laptops or PCs in Badenoch as we have a computer suite where PC learners can attend classes.

### Planned project milestones

* Purchase 2 laptops for students who do not have their own to borrow during the sessions. Development of course descriptors, session plans and course materials between tutor and Co-ordinator which forms the content of the courses and foundations for quality assurance and monitoring. 10 hours of work for 2 people plus administrative support and report to SCVO submitted: December 2015
* First round of courses marketed, learners signed up, 5 weeks of 2 hour tutor lead sessions completed, feedback and quality monitoring paperwork completed and report to SCVO submitted: February 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes
