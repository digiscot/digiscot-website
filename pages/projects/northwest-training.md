## Project plan

### Project description

Workshops for digitizing creative writers’ work to CD, booklet & digital magazine to be circulated to older residents in the community & at Kinlochbervie Day Care Centre. Photo scanning workshops plus tuition in basic computer skills for older people to stimulate interest in generating stories to contribute to Stories & Memories publication.

Enjoyed meeting Project Leaders & SCVO staff at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall 21 April for project management training.  An inspiring start to our Project.

Marketing drive in momentum.  Posters and leaflets looking good. Liaising with Taigh Ceilidh Day Care Centre today in Kinlochbervie and meeting some of the elderly clients to raise the project profile and inspire interest.  First client booked in for next Tuesday for support on using a tablet and a group session booked in for Wednesday 13 May.  Creative Writers also invited to join up for sessions on 18 May and 15 June at the Training Centre to learn more about digitising their work and inspiration for writing.

Project is gaining momentum with some fantastic work by our creative writers well on their way to creating their first publication for our project.  Elderly learners have also enjoyed afternoon sessions at the local Day Care Centre for basic ICT skills.  We take a break now for the summer holidays but are looking ahead to more digital learning in August.  Here is a picture of some our Creative Writers in action having just received their new USB sticks for saving their work!

Since August everyone has been working really hard. Weekly basic ICT sessions at the Kinlochbervie Day Care Centre offering support with new tablets, smartphones, photo-scanning, e-mail, online shopping and basic wordprocessing has proved really successful and made using ICT less scary and more accessible.  Members of the Day Care Centre were keen to provide old photos for scanning for an 'end of term' slideshow presentation quiz which was very well received.  Meanwhile the Creative Writers have been extremely industrious and got their collection of short stories, poems and selected photos into print learning new ICT skills along the way for this purpose.

In September the Day Care Centre Committee were pleased to see the printers proof copies of the Our Stories Your Memories booklet and here they are

A recording to CD was also made of a selection of the stories by way of promotion and for those with sight impairments. You can access this recording online at our website http://northwesttrainingcentre.weebly.com on the Our Stories Project page.

The Our Stories and Your Memories book is currently being sent out to elderly and isolated members of the North West Sutherland Community but here are some members of the community already enjoying the fruits of this great project.

## Evaluation
The project was very rewarding to both ICT learners and recipients of the booklet & CD alike.  Using a photo theme to engage older learners proved popular however, the time involved in many of the activities with older learners was much longer than anticipated especially getting the booklet and CD into production.  We will shortly be fully appraising the passage of the project.

One learner made a particular poignant comment: caring for her spouse who suffers from dementia involves much of her time and previous excursions enjoyed together were no longer possible.  Using the internet to ‘travel’ wherever she wanted was a great outlet. In just this once instance, we feel that the project has contributed to increasing digital skills and reducing rural and social isolation in our area.

### Outputs and outcomes

Outputs delivered
The outputs for this project were provision of basic digital skills support for the elderly which was provided at the local day care centre at regular afternoon sessions as well as a few individual support sessions at our base/client’s home.  At the end of the project a powerpoint presentation of scanned photos was held at the day care centre inviting the recollection of memories and local community interest.

The local creative writing group was supported to produce a book of short stories and poems e.g help with basic computer & word-processing skills, recording audio, saving work to a usb stick.

The booklet and audio cd was circulated to the Kinlochbervie Day Care Centre members which includes local people from the other local villages townships e.g. Durness & Scourie.  Other elderly or isolated members of the local community have also been provided with the booklet/cd with the help of local care agencies & Citizens Advice Bureau and  both were  also provided to volunteers who read to the blind.

A digital audio file is available on our website so anyone can hear a selection of the stories published in the booklet.

Outcomes
The project contributed to a continued interest in digital skills and demand for more up to date public access ICT equipment at the Kinlochbervie Day Care Centre where we provided Basic ICT support sessions.  We know this because they are currently purchasing new computers for their members.

The project contributed to the continuity of the local Creative Writers Group who have been spurred on by getting their first publication into print.  They are more encouraged to value the benefits of ICT for creative writing purposes e.g. researching items for inspiration on the internet.  We know this because the creative writers plan to meet once a month and have encouraged new members to join them through  local posters.

A stronger link between the Creative Writers and Day Care Centre has been established and the Writers have decided to use the centre as their meeting place for future sessions.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:
ICT support for Older Learners:
Flexible tutor approach to digital skill support for older learners: Even within a group of 25-30 clients it was not always easy to get a group/pair of learners wanting tuition on the same topic.
Using 1:1 slots to concentrate on older learners’ needs works best.
Using client’s own equipment e.g. tablet, smartphone best value to client for familiarisation with learning something new.
Incorporating ICT support into day care centre afternoon activities when clients can ‘drop-in’ for ICT support works best rather than setting up stand alone sessions.
Older learners e.g. 65+ need extra time and support for confidence – noticeable difference from 55-65 age group.
Organising activities for older learners takes time and encouragement to get everyone on board.


ICT support for Creative Writers & production of publication
Younger creative writers  (55+) more confident in using ICT and more receptive to how computers can aid their work.
It was useful to use an online publisher so that contributors to publication can see digital version before final print rather than wait for hard copy proofs which then have to be circulated to writing group.  We used a company called Mixam who were excellent in every stage of the process.

We were pleased to find that there is a variety of software available at little or no cost for sound recording and editing e.g. Garageband, Audacity, Soundcloud.
We were pleased to use Soundcloud (free) for a digital audio file that we embedded on our website.

Things we would do differently:
Time involved in getting writers’ to agree on format for publication/proof reading/ selection of pictures  far exceeded what we anticipated and we would allow much more time for this process and general project management.

We found that interest of 65+ learners in photos scanning was limited to learners scanning photos of their past and contributing to a photo presentation but not writing about it.  This may be also be symptomatic of our remote community where people can be shyer at coming forward.  However, there was healthy interest in task specific ICT support as mentioned above which was the thrust of the project.

Overall a great project with much thanks to SCVO Digital Challenge Fund
