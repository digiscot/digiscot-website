## Project plan

### Project description

Castle Douglas Community IT Centre will deliver training on using tablet devices to older people who currently have no access to the internet at home and don’t already own an internet enabled device. Delivery of this project will have two strands - a weekly 2 hour session for 4 weeks supplemented with supported practice or refresher sessions as required. Course content will include basic tablet control skills, accessing the internet, accessing online services (public and private sector) sending/receiving emails, video calling and social networking sessions targeted at improving communication with others. Participants will be provided with a tablet device to use at home for the duration of their course and signposted to local wireless ‘hotspots’ where they will be able to access the internet for free or at a low cost. Participants will learn how technology can bring them closer to friends and relatives, engage with hobbies and interests and access information online.
