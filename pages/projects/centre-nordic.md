## Project plan

### Project description

CNS will work with elderly members of the Orkney and Shetland Community to teach them how to use digital technology through the use of the app Fieldtrip GB. People will be able to capture minor place-names and stories attached to specific places in the landscape. The data captured will be uploaded to a website, which will form a lasting legacy and which will also continuously be used to add more data. Participants will also be trained in scanning photographs and uploading other types of material to the project website.


## Project milestones 
Orkney

Milestone 1: Purchase of smart phones and printer/scanner. Advertise the workshop in The Orcadian. Match funding for staff time: Initial meeting with the Orkney Heritage Society on 22 April. Appearance on BBC Radio Orkney, press release for the Orcadian. Contact other local heritage societies and small museums.  Set up ‘skeleton’ website.  Develop questionnaire for EDINA app and test new smart phones.	Marketing using posters to promote our project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and will gain participants for our workshop and field days. This is all to ensure we are ready to start working on the project by the envisaged start date of May 25. Expected completion date: 4/6/15	

Milestone 2: Workshop held in late May/early June. Community work with participants for Alex Sanmark and Ragnhild Ljosland with data capturing and uploading material to the website. Participants will also be given help with scanning and other digital tasks relating to the project. This is the overall aim of the project and will teach participants to use digital technology. We will also gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who can spread the project further. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS assesses the progress of the project at its half-way point, reports back to SCVO, and ensures that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. 	Expected completion date: July 31st 

Milestone 4: Additional work on the website. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation. This work will make sure that the website contains all data captured so far and will give training to new participants or existing ones still in need of help. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Shetland
 
Milestone 1: Hold initial meeting with Chair of Shetland Heritage Association and discuss project 18th May.  Show her how to use Fieldtrip GB. Send out leaflets to all members of association including local museums and history clubs. Purchase 6 x Hudl2 by 5th June.  Match funding for staff time. Advertise the workshop of 5th June being held at Shetland College on 29th May in The Shetland Times. Give appearance on BBC Radio Shetland and press release for the Shetland Times. Work with Orkney CNS to set up ‘skeleton’ website and develop online map. Develop Shetland version of questionnaire for Fieldtrip GB app and test Hudls. Carry out marketing using posters to promote the project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and to gain participants for our workshop and field days. The posters will be distributed throughout the learning centres in Shetland. This is will ensure the project will be ready to start of envisaged start date of June 5th. Expected completion date: 4/6/15               
 
Milestone 2: Workshop held on 5th June by Andrew Jennings. Intensive community work in the islands by Andrew Jennings sharing knowledge with elderly participants and showing them how to capture data and upload the material to the website. Participants will also be given help with other digital tasks relating to the project. The overall aim of the project is to teach participants how to use digital technology. The Chair of Shetland Heritage Association will help us gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who will spread the project further, particularly to the outlying areas such as Fair Isle, the north Isles of Unst and Yell, and further to Skerries. Expected completion date: 30/9/15
 
Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS will assess the progress of the project at its half-way point, reports back to SCVO, and ensures that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. Expected completion date:  July 31st 
 
Milestone 4: Additional work on the website, including developing the map of Orkney and Shetland. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants from throughout Shetland. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation in Shetland College. This work will make sure that the website contains all data captured so far and will give training to new participants or existing ones still in need of help. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

**Achievements:**

On April 18 Ragnhild Ljosland and Alex Sanmark gave a presentation to the Orkney Heritage Society. The members were delighted and were keen to be involved. A new meeting has been scheduled.

During the first days of May Ragnhild Ljosland started the community visits to inform about the project. This time it was North Ronaldsay, the northernmost of the Orkney Islands. The leaflet she brought with her can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/NordicUHI/status/595520414723485697) 

Our Orkney press release is out! Date of the first workshop set to June 6. [See it here](http://www.orkney.uhi.ac.uk/news/orkney-community-digital-heritage-project) We were also interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney about the project and our forthcoming workshop. 

During  early May Andrew met Pat Christie of Shetland Heritage Association and began the process of meeting elderly people in Shetland keen on preserving their heritage. Our Shetland press release is also out! [See it here](http://www.shetland.uhi.ac.uk/news/heritage-to-be-explored-through-smart-technology) Our new Facebook group Shetland Digital Heritage Project is also up and running. Andrew was interviewed by BBC Radio Shetland on 04/06. 
The date of the workshop is also set for June 6. We are going to connect Orkney and Shetland with VC.

Update from Orkney. Milestone 1 has been completed and we are now working towards Milestone 2. The following activities have taken place:   
3rd June:
Ragnhild Ljosland spent the day in the island of Sanday, where she met with the local Afternoon Club. This is a club for retired people which meets on a Wednesday afternoon in the Sanday Community Centre and invites speakers and activities. The Orkney Community Digital Heritage project made contact and was invited to the Afternoon Club to speak about the project and hold a workshop. 15 Afternoon Club members attended. They were informed about the project aims, and were shown some of the records which have already been uploaded to the collection. They all thought it was a good idea for a project, and some had ideas for sites in Sanday which could be included. In the workshop, they all got to try a Hudl tablet, and some of them found it enjoyable while others found it difficult. A couple had previous experience using a tablet, but most were beginners. We recorded the Sanday Community Centre together and spoke about how they could then make more records themselves at the places in the island where they have memories to share.

Lesson learned: Some of the oldest people felt they were 'too old' to learn anything new and also that their information wasn’t 'valuable'. There is a big threshold from showing them as a group, and getting them to try it there and then, to actually going out and recording things themselves. They seemed interested while we were trying it in the community centre, but then at the end when I asked who would like to take a Hudl home to have a go themselves then nobody took one. (However, two people had their own iPads and they said they would collect information on them). The lesson is that for very old people, you need a person to accompany them out in the field while they make the records. Simply showing them how to do it is not enough. You can see a picture of the event (here)[https://twitter.com/NordicUHI/status/610830734782300160] 

6th June. Workshop held at Orkney College. A number of people turned up, who all had their own tablets and smart phones. They were very inspired by the project and felt that they had information that they wanted to record. One participant in particular was keen to teach other older community members how to use the app. She had one or two particular people in mind. At the beginning of the workshop we connected to Shetland via VC link to say hello to the participants there. 

12th June:
Two members of the public visited Centre for Nordic Studies. They had missed the workshop on 6th June and came in to learn how to take part in the project. We guided them through how to use Fieldtrip on a tablet. They intended to involve their parents in the project.

Lesson learned: These were people in their 60s who were experienced users of digital technology. They picked up in a few minutes what it took 90 minutes for the Sanday Afternoon Club members to learn. They will aid the project by accompanying their parents out to record things.

16th June:
Ragnhild Ljosland spent an hour and a half with a project participant: a 64-year-old who had never used a tablet before. The participant has grown up in Kirkwall and the time was spent walking around the centre of Kirkwall making records of memories and stories from the 1950s and 60s.

Lesson learned: This participant had never used a tablet before, but found the project very enjoyable and reasonably easy, although she did have some trouble at first finding the right technique to touch the screen – not to short and not too long. We got a lot of recording done and the participant was getting the hang of using the tablet by the end. It shows that accompanying participants out in the field, one-to-one, is a worthwhile thing to do. You can see

## Evaluation

The project will be continuously evaluated. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the start and end of the project. 10% of the participants will also be interviewed. In this way CNS will establish the success of the project from the start. The amount of data captured and uploaded will also be continuously monitored. 


### Outputs and outcomes
