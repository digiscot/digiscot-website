## Project plan

### Project description

CNS will work with elderly members of the Orkney Community to teach them how to use digital technology through the use of the app Fieldwork GB. People will be able to capture minor place-names and stories attached to specific places in the landscape. The data captured will be uploaded to a website, which will form a lasting legacy and which will also continuously be used to add more data. Participants will also be trained in scanning photographs and uploading other types of material to the project website.


## Project milestones

Milestone 1: Purchase of smart phones and printer/scanner. Advertise the workshop in The Orcadian. Match funding for staff time: Initial meeting with the Orkney Heritage Society on 22 April. Appearance on BBC Radio Orkney, press release for the Orcadian. Contact other local heritage societies and small museums.  Set up ‘skeleton’ website.  Develop questionnaire for EDINA app and test new smart phones.	Marketing using posters to promote our project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and will gain participants for our workshop and field days. This is all to ensure we are ready to start working on the project by the envisaged start date of May 25. Expected completion date: 25/5/15	

Milestone 2: Workshop held in late May/early June. Community work with participants for Alex Sanmark and Ragnhild Ljosland with data capturing and uploading material to the website. Participants will also be given help with scanning and other digital tasks relating to the project. This is the overall aim of the project and will teach participants to use digital technology. We will also gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who can spread the project further. Expected completion date: 1/10/15

Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS assesses the progress of the project at its half-way point, reports back to SCVO, and ensures that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. 	Expected completion date: 1 September

Milestone 4: Additional work on the website. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation. This work will make sure that the website contains all data captured so far and will give training to new participants or existing ones still in need of help. Expected completion date: 25/12/15

During the first days of May Ragnhild Ljosland started the community visits to inform about the project. This time it was North Ronaldsay, the northernmost of the Orkney Islands. The leaflet she brought with her can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/NordicUHI/status/595520414723485697) 

Our Orkney press release is out! Date of the first workshop set to June 6. [See it here](http://www.orkney.uhi.ac.uk/news/orkney-community-digital-heritage-project) 

## Evaluation

The project will be continuously evaluated. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the start and end of the project. 10% of the participants will also be interviewed. In this way CNS will establish the success of the project from the start. The amount of data captured and uploaded will also be continuously monitored.
