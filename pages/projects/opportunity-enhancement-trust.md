## Project plan

### Project description

Digital Skills Through Football is an education course which helps people with some interest in football – at any level – to use that interest to develop skills that are useful in both further education and the world of work. 

It provides the opportunity to gain a certificate at SCQF levels 2, 3, or 4 and the level of certificate awarded depends entirely on how well the student performs over their time on the course. 


## Project milestones
