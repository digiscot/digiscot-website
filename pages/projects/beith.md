### Project description

IT for U will operate from our High St shopfront, it will be run by existing Astro Work staff and is aimed at customers who want to use IT to improve their employment prospects and local people who want to gain practical skills and knowledge of the IT skills that which are necessary to be IT competent in the digital age. The project will use desktop machines, laptops, tablets and phones to demonstrate how the effective use of digital media can improve quality of life and increase employability prospects.

For customers or residents who are already in employment, but whose role doesn’t involve IT skills we will concentrate on upskilling on basic internet use, safety and privacy and utilizing access to the internet to add quality to their lives, eg how to search for and access wi-fi areas when out and about, facebook pages to keep up with friends and family, taking, storing and sharing pictures and videos, online shopping, skype accounts, genealogy accounts etc. The content of the course will be participant led.

For customers and residents seeking employment, or to change their employment circumstances, participation in the project will equip them with the skills to set up an email account, send and receive email messages on a range of handheld devices, how to open a universal jobmatch account, build and amend their CV to make it appropriate to vacancies.

Our High St venue is an under-utilised ex-retail premises, we will set up an IT suite therein. Our staff are based there 5 days a week and we operate a drop in system. Beith Trust endeavours to cater to the needs, interests and capacity of our customers. The IT for U services will be bespoke to each customer – a program that suits their interests will be designed – they will be able to design it from a range of options which will include – small groupwork activity, online social activity – facebook – Instagram, 1-2-1 with a dedicated worker and ongoing support to allow participants to ‘practice’ their developing skills so that skills gained can be developed and built on.

Beith Trust is a community led enterprise which was formed to tackle the social, economic, environmental and physical regeneration of the community of Beith and the wider Garnock Valley.

### Evaluation
+Over the course of the project 156 people visited for employability support, of those 57 people attended 169 times for support connected to digital skills.   Our employability coach worked mainly on a 1-2-1 basis with these people.  Of the 156 people who attended 62% progressed to employment, further education or volunteering.  Of the 57 people who attended for Digital Skills support 80% reported that they had more confidence working on line, 50% have moved into employment, 25% into volunteering and 25% are regularly talking to family via Skype. A small number of participants simply wanted help to overcome the digital barriers they met trying to access employment or training opportunties and reported that they had no interest in learning digital skills

### Lessons learned
The initial set-up in the shop unit proved problematical, there were issues of space and wifi connectivity. So the project was conducted from the Employability Hub at Beith Astro. The layout in the office was changed to allow small group working, and the first course commenced. Everyone had very different levels of digital skills and we had to work hard to maintain engagement for those who were more digitally savvy, while still supporting those with developing skills.
Another area where staff required immediate upskilling, was the variety of technology and operating systems available to the participants, it was no good showing someone how to use Windows 10 on a PC, if their mode of access at home was Windows 7 on a tablet, so we actively encourage participants to bring their device to the classes, teaching them to use both.
Although taking referrals from a variety of external organisations (Jobcentre, NHS, Local Authority, Training Organisations) as well as through our own marketing, demand for the classes was not as high as anticipated and there is ongoing networking taking place to reach different sectors of the community. There was also more of a demand for 1-2-1 tuition rather than in the group setting, generally due to participants embarrassment. However, once initial confidence has been boosted, we move participants into a group setting and it's great to see the power of peer support in action! From the initial group of participants, 50% have moved into employment, 25% into volunteering and 25% are regularly talking to family via Skype! Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and classes continue.
