## Project plan

### Project description

To recruit a part time Volunteer Coordinator to oversee the delivery of a Volunteer Digital Champions programme for the Smart Communities Project. This will allow us to develop a new strand which will encourage the sharing of knowledge and provide valuable experience and relevant qualifications for volunteers, enhancing their opportunities for employment and increasing our capacity to positively affect change for people living in our communities. The outcomes of the project are to recruit 30 Volunteer Digital Champions across the 5 communities with the aim of each volunteer assisting 2 local people to help them develop their digital skills and access. This will be achieved with the support of the Volunteer Coordinator who will ensure the recruitment, opportunity, support and accreditation for each volunteer in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College.


## Project milestones

We have recruited a Volunteer Co-Ordinator, Simon, to help us to expand and improve our Digital Champions Program. Simon has an IT background and has worked on a Digital Inclusion project in the past. Simon is due to start at the beginning of June and will be key for the project’s recruitment and training of Digital Champions.  

We have also identified members of the community who currently volunteer at our events who would be ideal candidates to complete the Digital Champion Training.

One of our volunteers, Jane, helps out at our weekly Drop-In sessions in Calton. Jane usually supports people who are job-searching, especially helping with creating and editing CVs, uploading and attaching CVs, and email correspondence with possible employers. 

The second volunteer, Frank, is from an IT background and uses his considerable experience to help run our monthly CoderDojo session in Castlemilk. We work in partnership with CoderDojo Scotland to provide a local coding club to children aged 8-11 in the Castlemilk area. This is intended to help young people in the area access the opportunity to learn more about coding (computer programming) in their local community. A number of CoderDojo volunteers from across the central belt help to run the session, and Frank is a local resident who offered to lend his services to the project.

Claire, another volunteer, has also helped out at a Drop-In session based in Tureen Street, at the heart of a Retirement Housing community. This session tends to be attended by older people from the community who are interested in getting to grips with the basics of IT.

We also have a number of local people who are interested in becoming Digital Champion volunteers and an existing Digital Champion to help support our new volunteers. These volunteers will help us to provide new and additional services to the communities we work in.
