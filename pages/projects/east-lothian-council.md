### Project description

The project will aim to increase digital inclusion within the visually impaired people of East Lothian ensuring they are able to play a part in the life of their communities. This will be achieved through very small classes consisting of the visually impaired person and their partner/carer and the tutor. The tutor in this case will be Jane McWhirter, Assitant Customer Service Officer in Wallyford Library. Jane is a qualified teacher with a natural passion and flair for ICT. 

The classes will be held in Wallyford Library when it is closed so Jane can give her full attention to her students. Wallyford has very good transport links to the rest of the county with a train station and frequent bus service. The 6 mini IPads bought from a previous bid will be used or if the student prefers they will use their own device. Jane has led a few classes previously and from experience knows that 2 people per class is sufficient and necessary for the most to be gained by participants. 

It is envisaged that classes will take place weekly and a session will last for 3 hours. Each student will receive 6 sessions in total or less dependent on need.

### Planned project milestones

* Advertise for students - in libraries via posters and social media. Also contact residents known to the equalities officer and via the Messenger newspaper: December 2015
* Classes will begin with the first 2 students: January 2016
* Classes completed for group 3: May 2016
* Classes are completed for group 7: October 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* East Lothian Library Service increases membership and issues of resources e.g. Books on CD, eaudio books
