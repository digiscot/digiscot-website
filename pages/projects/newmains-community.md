### Project description

The project will be delivered at the NCT Centre, which is a new purpose built community owned community centre in a central location within Newmains. As a new build it meet the latest environmental and access standards with free wi-fi access throughout the building.

The project is aimed at the elderly, those seeking employment or benefits, however, the access to free wi-fi and the making available access to a lap top computer as required will help to serve the wider community.

With the creation and build of the NCT Centre as a major project within Newmains a great deal of work has been put in with the development of partnerships to enable activities to meet local community needs to be delivered at the NCT Centre and removing one of the main barriers for the need to travel.

This digital inclusion project aims at improving the basic digital knowledge and skills of the participant through running training as follows:

* Elders 3 programmes of 1 hour per week sessions over 13 weeks periods for computer use

* Elders 3 programmes of 1 hour per week sessions over 13 weeks periods for tablet use

* Unemployed 3 x programmes of 2 hours per week sessions over 13 week periods on basic digital skills with focus on job search, cv’s and job applications

* Adult Learners 3 x programmes of 2 hours per session over 13 week periods on basic digital skills including where appropriate completion of benefit applications and job applications

These classes will be arranged by the NCT Centre Manager in partnership with the local community NLC Community Learning and Development and New College Lanarkshire to maximise community participation and allow capture of any of the more difficult to reach.

The funding will allow for the set-up of a portable IT Classroom that will be used by the participant of this project, one of the laptops, or more if necessary, will be made available on a daily basis for use by any member of the local communities to undertake work seeking employment and/or benefits.

The greatest benefit that this project will bring is in making available locally the opportunity to take part in digital inclusion classes where these have traditionally been held in Wishaw and Shotts. These again have been poorly attended by Newmains residents due to their inability to travel through either financial, mobility or timing reasons.

### Planned project milestones

* Provision of all IT equipment and preparation for running of programmes: December 2015

"Classroom in a Box" has been set up with secure storage/charing cabinet and 12 laptop computers available for participant learning, online nettwork printer and associate equipment available. Laptops are running with Windows 7 and Microdoft Office 2010.  Equipment set up and ready for commencement of first programme of sessions in January 2016.  After some initial teething problems, including fingers, everything seems to be working fine.

* Promotion and recruitment for first Digital Inclusion programme: December 2015

Partnership delivery for sessions agreed with the following partners for the fist programme of sessions:

North Lanarkshire Council Community Learning and Development working with Seniors With Energetic Life Styles (SWELS) elders group - this group has been rubning successfully with numbers now standing at 9 participants, the Tutor has brought in some interesting local information for producing documets and working with photographs that has gone down well with the group.

Routes to Work working with those seeking employment, unfortunately this has been a bit of a slow starter with only 4 participants.  A new promotion of the programme within the local area, Routes to Work and Job Centre has some potential to increase the number of particpants.

New College Lanarkshire for adults looking to improve their digital participation skills for seeking benefits.  After a delay this has now started with 9 participnts from a very mixed background. This course is running for tw hours per session each week through until mid April.

* Completion of delivery of first series of programmes 1 x Elders PC, 1 x Elders Tablet, 1 x Adults seeking employent and 1 x adullts general/benefits in partnership with North Lanarkshire Council community Learning and Development and New College Lanarkhire: March 2016

* Completion of delivery of second series of programmes 1 x Elders PC, 1 x Elders Tablet, 1 x Adults seeking employent and 1 x adullts general/benefits in partnership with North Lanarkshire Council community Learning and Development and New College Lanarkhire: May 2016

* Completion of delivery of Third series of programmes 1 x Elders PC, 1 x Elders Tablet, 1 x Adults seeking employent and 1 x adullts general/benefits in partnership with North Lanarkshire Council community Learning and Development and New College Lanarkhire: September 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Increase in skills and knowledge in basic IT skills amongst the elderly, those seeking employment and those seeking benefits

* Increase in understanding and ability to keep safe when using the internet

* Increase in confidence of those participating in using IT for personal and social use

* Increase in personal social development in addition to improvements in health and well-being through attaining employment, benefits and inclusion.


### Evaluation


### Lessons learned

Originally we had planned to use new laptop computers from a local well known national outlet.  A decision was mad to use reconditioned laptops from Happus (http://www.happus.eu/) which has allowed us to increase the number of laptops available for participants.  They also cam with appropriate Microsoft software allowing a savings on software.

From a previous position I knew of a supplier of software for charity organisations at a much reduced cost.  I have been able to use this for this project and would recommend if you are a registered charity to look at tt-exchange (https://www.tt-exchange.org/) for your software requirements.
