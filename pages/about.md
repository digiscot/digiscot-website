Scotland is already a digital nation.  Eight in ten households have an internet connection and four in ten have a tablet computer.  Six in ten people use a smartphone.  For those who have access, motivation and skills to get things done online, life is enhanced.

But still far too many people in Scotland risk being left behind as they lack the [basic digital skills](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/about/basic-digital-skills/) to communicate, find information, get things done and stay safe on the web. What's more, many charities and voluntary organisations are missing a huge opportunity to boost their impact and engagement by using digital tools.

We’re part of the [Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations](http://www.scvo.org.uk) (SCVO), and are working with partners across the country to promote digital participation. Our work is generously supported by core funding from the [Scottish Government](http://www.gov.scot), and closely linked to the wider [Digital Scotland](http://www.digitalscotland.org/) agenda.

Our team also manages SCVO's public facing websites and web services (including [Goodmoves](http://www.goodmoves.org.uk), [Funding Scotland](http://www.fundingscotland.com) and [The Gathering](http://gatherscotland.org.uk/)), and incubates new digital products through [SCVO Labs](http://labs.scvo.org.uk/).
