We know that digital has the potential to transform organisations. As part of our One Digital project we are testing different approaches to support the third sector to get more digital.

We invited applications from Senior Leaders from across the sector to join Action Learning sets to explore and find solutions for the challenges they face.

**The response was fantastic** – 48 senior leaders applied. Interestingly the majority of applications were from paid staff, rather than trustees:

Applications came from across the sector, with the highest proportion from organisations with a health focus:

All applicants were asked to identify the areas where they faced the biggest challenge, and felt that action learning could help them to find solutions. Again the responses showed a wide variety of issues and interests:

We are going to run three separate sets to offer places to as many people as possible. We will also be rolling out networking events to build on the interest and demand, and to better understand why we didn't receive more applications from trustees.

Our first sets will start next week, February 25<sup>th</sup>. The senior leaders who will be working together through this process will have the chance to tackle head on some of the thorny issues that can make it difficult to fully embrace digital.

If you are interested in following our progress, and benefiting from the learning that we gather keep an eye on our [website](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/onedigital/actionlearning/) and #onedigital.
