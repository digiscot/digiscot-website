In One Digital and more widely within SCVO's digital participation team we’re always being asked, 'so which organisations are using digital really well?’ It’s a simple question which is more often than not tricky to answer. Digital can mean so many things. Here in SCVO we take the [Co-op’s definition](https://digital.blogs.coop/2016/06/14/what-we-mean-when-we-say-digital/) as a starting point: ‘Applying the culture, practices, processes and technologies of the Internet era to respond to people’s raised expectations’. 

Often for organisations their entry point is around social media and less often we find excellent examples of organisations using digital for improving service delivery.  

Whilst smaller organisations may be doing a great job with digital, they have less capacity to shout about it – they’re just doing great service delivery.

The following blog by [Rebecca Curtis-Moss](http://www.rebeccacurtismoss.co.uk/) is a really useful and timely piece shining a light on some examples of what’s going on in our sector in Scotland. There might be a gem of an idea in there for you to integrate into your organisation's work, and if not, I hope that it at least sparks something for you to go and find out more about...

<strong>A digital snapshot of the Scottish third sector</strong> 

As a digital communications trainer, I constantly come across small charities who recognise a need to get online and use digital tools, but have no idea where to start. It can be difficult to take that first digital step, but I can promise you that once you've done it, you'll never look back. 

Here's my round-up of some charities already doing a great job in digital, and what you can learn from them:  

<strong>[1.Shift MS](https://shift.ms/)</strong>

A platform 'for MSers, by MSers', Shift MS have a fantastic range of free digital services for their members. Their stand-out project is 'MS Reporters', which aims to 'transform people with MS from being passive recipients of information on their condition, to active participants'. This project trains people with MS to become citizen journalists, and as such, representatives of their community. They hold MS experts to account, and film their meetings to build a video library of expert knowledge that's accessible to the wider community. Here's an example:

If you'd like to find out more about citizen journalism, I highly recommend checking out [Digital Commonwealth](http://digitalcommonwealth.co.uk/), run by [Jennifer Jones](http://jennifermjones.net/). 

<strong>[2. Young Scot](http://young.scot/)</strong> 

Young Scot have come a long way from when I was at school, when one of their best benefits was a free cheeseburger at MacDonald's! In the last decade, Young Scot have become digital pioneers in the Scottish third sector. Brilliant content curators and boasting an impressive suite of social media channels, their digital communications never fail to impress. But that's not what I want to talk about here; instead, I'm going to focus on their Rewards system. Young Scot Rewards provide a digital incentive for participation in activities both online and offline, including volunteering with local charities; filling out surveys on topics like health and wellbeing; and watching videos on important issues affecting young people. Rewards include tickets to gigs and shows and equipment. Their system currently has over 70,000 users in Scotland, and is an excellent example of how you could use digital space to influence social action. 

Even if you don't have the capacity to offer something on this scale, there's still lots to be learnt from Young Scot. Regardless of size, resources or capacity, all charities can take basic steps to add value for their supporters and beneficiaries. Read more about adding value to your supporters in my blog, ['What MND Awareness Month Taught Me About Campaigning'](http://www.rebeccacurtismoss.co.uk/index.php/2016/07/14/what-mnd-awareness-month-taught-me-about-campaigning/). 

If you work with young people, you can contact Young Scot to set up reward points for your own young supporters.

<strong>[3. Shelter Scotland](http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/)</strong>

Last weekend, Shelter Scotland ran their first ever hackathon. For those of you wondering what I'm on about, a hackathon is when you get people together from various backgrounds across the digital and business sectors, so they can develop products such as mobile apps, websites, or any other online resource for social good. Amongst the housing and homeless related products created for over one gruelling weekend were a game to explain homelessness issues; a money saving app for people who don't have access to a bank account; and a social media Chatbot, answering emergency housing questions in real-time.

Now, I know that many of you will be reading this sceptically, thinking there's no way that your charity could host a hackathon. In most cases, you're right: it takes a lot of resources. Luckily for you, though, there are plenty of hackathons looking for charity participants. So, if you're a small charity looking to develop an app or a website but don't have the technical knowledge, or can't afford agency fees, this could be an option. 

I was recently involved in [8 Hours Overtime](http://www.8-i.org/) in Edinburgh, which vastly improved the digital presence of ten local charities, including Scottish Adoption, The Teapot Trust, and Crossing Countries. If this is something your charity would like to get involve in, keep an eye out on social media for call-outs for participants.
